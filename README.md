# Inception

Inception is a project designed to facilitate learning the concept of containerization and Docker through the process of containerizing multiple servers, such as WordPress, Nginx, and MariaDB. Additionally, it covers the creation of Docker images and the usage of Docker Compose to manage multi-container Docker applications.

## Introduction

Inception aims to provide a hands-on experience with containerization technologies, specifically Docker, by guiding users through the process of containerizing and orchestrating multiple services commonly used in web development. By working with WordPress, Nginx, and MariaDB, users gain practical insights into how containers can simplify the deployment and management of complex applications.

## Requirements

- Containerization of WordPress, Nginx, and MariaDB servers.
- Creation of Docker images for each server.
- Utilization of Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications.
- Easy setup and teardown of development environments.

## Skills Acquired

By working on the Inception project, users acquire the following skills:

- Understanding of containerization principles.
- Proficiency in using Docker for creating, managing, and deploying containers.
- Familiarity with Docker Compose for orchestrating multi-container applications.
- Knowledge of how to create custom Docker images tailored to specific application requirements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Docker: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Usage

Inception provides a platform for experimenting with containerization concepts and Docker. Here are some ways to make the most out of this project:

- Experiment with modifying the Dockerfiles to customize the container configurations.
- Explore Docker Compose to define multi-container applications and manage their lifecycle.
- Extend the project by adding more services or integrating additional tools.
